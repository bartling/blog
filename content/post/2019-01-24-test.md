On 23 January 2019, my colleague from DePaul's Environmental Science and Studies Department, Mark Potosnak, and I gave a short presentation on our reflections on the IPCC [Global Warming at 1.5](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) report.

[Here](https://www.hughbartling.com/slides/sr15_bartling#1) are the slides from my part of the talk.
