I have an article coming out soon analyzing electricity aggregation referendums in Illinois and, as such, I&#8217;ve been following how cities have been using this mechanism.

Community choice aggregation is available in seven states and it enables municipal governments to negotiate directly with utility suppliers for rates and terms on behalf of all of the customers in their jurisdiction.&nbsp; In some states voters must approve a referendum in order for local authorities to have the power to negotiate. Illinois municipalities went through a big wave of referendums in 2012. The past few elections have seen very few.

Ohio is another state that requires referendums to establish aggregation.&nbsp; There were a spattering earlier this month.&nbsp; A couple of highlights from November&#8217;s elections:&nbsp;

  * Voters in the Columbus suburb of Worthington, Ohio [voted 75% in favor][1] of aggregation.
  * Voters in Liberty Township, Ohio [voted to approve aggregation][2] for both electricity and natural gas.
  * Voters in Greene Township, Ohio [voted to approve aggregation][3] for both electricity and natural gas.
  * Voters in Auburn Township, Ohio [voted to approve electricity aggregation.][4]
