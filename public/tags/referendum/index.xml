      <description>I have an article coming out soon analyzing electricity aggregation referendums in Illinois and, as such, I&amp;#8217;ve been following how cities have been using this mechanism.
Community choice aggregation is available in seven states and it enables municipal governments to negotiate directly with utility suppliers for rates and terms on behalf of all of the customers in their jurisdiction.&amp;nbsp; In some states voters must approve a referendum in order for local authorities to have the power to negotiate.</description>
